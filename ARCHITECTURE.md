# ModernDataSciEng Platform — Architecture Principles

This document captures the architectural decisions that shape the platform. It's written for the team that maintains it — when you're trying to decide "should this be inline or in a drawer?" or "should we lazy-load this?", the answer is here.

## Core principle: thin index, lazy depth

**The entire platform is a thin index; the depth lives in drawers that open on demand.**

Every page is a lightweight summary of the topic. Heavy content (code samples, live research data, ADRs, recommendations, datasets) loads only when users explicitly request it — by clicking a button that opens a drawer.

This is the **progressive disclosure + lazy evaluation** pattern, applied consistently. It's how Stripe Docs, Vercel Docs, and modern documentation platforms work.

### Why this pattern

1. **Page load time is O(1) per page** — not O(content). A page with 5 code samples × 200 lines each weighs the same as a page with no code samples, because the code lives in drawers.
2. **Memory usage is O(active drawers)** — not O(all content on the page). Unopened drawers contribute zero DOM nodes.
3. **Server bandwidth = the heavy content is fetched from CDN on demand** — the page HTML is small; the drawer content (live data from arXiv/GitHub/HF) is fetched when the user opens.
4. **User experience = scan first, dive deep where interested** — users see the surface, expand what matters to them.

### Where lazy evaluation applies

| Pattern | Component | What's lazy |
|---|---|---|
| Multi-language code samples | `MultiLangSamples` (drawer mode) | Code blocks only render when drawer opens |
| Live research data | `LiveResearchDrawer`, `LiveResourcesDrawer` | arXiv + GitHub + HF + PwC fetched on demand, cached 24h in localStorage |
| ADR list | `LazyList` (Knowledge Hub) | First 5 ADRs render; rest load on "Show more" |
| Stack inventory, file formats, free tier | `LazyList` (Modern Big Data) | First 5-6 rows render; rest load on click |
| Recommended next pages | `ContextualBandit` (drawer) | Thompson sampling only runs when drawer opens |
| Animated Knowledge Shorts | `KnowledgeShorts` | SVG diagrams animate when active; other shorts are static |
| Python execution | `PyodideRunner` | ~10MB Pyodide runtime lazy-loads from CDN on first "Run" click; cached singleton |
| Floating live button | `FloatingLiveButton` | Tooltip appears on first visit; dismissible; pulse stops after dismissal |

## The drawer architecture

Every drawer is a self-contained lazy-loaded unit:

```
Page (lightweight index)
├── SectionCard (summary + description)
│   └── Button trigger → opens drawer
│       └── Drawer (Sheet component)
│           ├── Header (title + description)
│           ├── Content (lazy-loaded on open)
│           │   ├── Fetches from CDN/API if needed
│           │   ├── Renders only when drawer is open
│           │   └── Caches in localStorage where appropriate
│           └── Footer (file types, links, actions)
```

### Drawer inventory

| Drawer | Component | What it contains | Lazy-fetch source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Multi-language code samples | `MultiLangSamples` (drawer mode) | 5+ language tabs × code blocks | None (code is in JS bundle) |
| Live research | `LiveResearchDrawer` | arXiv + GitHub + PwC + Semantic Scholar | Real API calls on open |
| Live resources | `LiveResourcesDrawer` | arXiv + GitHub + Hugging Face + PwC + raw GitHub code | Real API calls on open |
| Recommended pages | `ContextualBandit` | 5 Thompson-sampled page recommendations | localStorage bandit state |
| Knowledge Shorts | `KnowledgeShorts` | 10 animated SVG diagrams + subtitle reveals | None (all client-side) |
| Pyodide execution | `PyodideRunner` | Python output panel | Pyodide Wasm runtime from CDN |

## The lazy evaluation hierarchy

From least-lazy to most-lazy:

1. **Always render** — page headers, section titles, the floating button, the sidebar nav. These are the "index" — they must be there for the page to make sense.

2. **Render on page mount** — KPI cards, executive summaries, the section card titles. These are the "surface" — users see them immediately, they're cheap to render.

3. **Render on scroll** — `LazyList` with `autoLoadOnScroll` enabled. The first N items render; the next batch loads when the user scrolls near the bottom via IntersectionObserver.

4. **Render on click** — drawer triggers (buttons). The button is in the DOM; the drawer content isn't. Clicking loads the content.

5. **Fetch on open** — `LiveResearchDrawer`, `LiveResourcesDrawer`. The drawer opens → fetches real-time data from arXiv/GitHub/HF/PwC. Cached in localStorage for 24h.

6. **Compute on open** — `ContextualBandit`. Thompson sampling (Beta distribution via Marsaglia-Tsang Gamma) only runs when the drawer opens. Zero computation on page mount.

7. **Lazy-load Wasm on first use** — `PyodideRunner`. ~10MB Pyodide runtime loads from CDN on first "Run" click. Cached as a singleton promise — subsequent runs on any page are instant.

## The bandit architecture

Two Thompson sampling bandits power adaptive behaviour:

### 1. Knowledge Shorts bandit (`KnowledgeShorts` component)

- Per-short Beta(α, β) posterior in localStorage (`mdse-shorts-bandit-v1`)
- Wins: click + completion → α+1; Skips: skip → β+1
- Samples via Marsaglia-Tsang Gamma → Beta ratio
- Picks next short by max sampled posterior
- Persists across sessions

### 2. Page recommendations bandit (`ContextualBandit` component)

- Per-page Beta(α, β) posterior in localStorage (`mdse-pages-bandit-v1`)
- Wins: visiting a page → α+1; Losses: skipping a recommendation → β+1
- Contextual features:
  - Same-group boost: 1.5× multiplier on sampled posterior
  - Time-of-day: Analytics pages get 1.2× boost during morning hours (7-11am)
- Lazy: sampling only runs when the drawer opens (not on page mount)
- Persists across sessions — learns the user's navigation preferences

## The sync + deploy pipeline

```
Private repo (AppDataSci3-Advanced)
  ↓ push to main
  ↓
sync-to-public.yml workflow
  ↓ force-push to public repo
  ↓
Demo3AppDataSci (public)
  ↓ push to main
  ↓
deploy-pages.yml workflow
  ↓ build static export (GITHUB_PAGES=true)
  ↓ excludes src/app/api/ (Next.js export doesn't support API routes)
  ↓ deploy to GitHub Pages via actions/deploy-pages@v4
  ↓
https://testdemoqwenai2025-creator.github.io/Demo3AppDataSci/
```

### Workflow guard

The sync workflow has a `if: github.repository == 'testdemoqwenai2025-creator/AppDataSci3-Advanced'` guard — it only runs on the private repo, not on the public mirror (where it would try to "sync to itself" and fail without the secret).

## The routing architecture

15+ pages, each a real Next.js route (`src/app/<page-id>/page.tsx`).

- **No hash routing** — every page is a real URL (`/databricks`, not `/#/databricks`)
- **Backward compat** — old `#/databricks` URLs are auto-redirected to `/databricks` via a useEffect in AppShell
- **AppShell in layout.tsx** — wraps every route with sidebar + header + footer + floating button
- **Active route detection** — `usePathname()` in AppShell determines which sidebar entry is highlighted
- **404 page** — `not-found.tsx` for graceful handling

## The free-tier + open-source stack

The platform itself uses only free-tier + OSS:

- **Next.js 16** (MIT) — framework
- **Tailwind CSS 4** (MIT) — styling
- **shadcn/ui** (MIT) — component library
- **Recharts** (MIT) — charts
- **Framer Motion** (MIT) — animations
- **Pyodide** (Apache 2.0) — Python in Wasm
- **z-ai-web-dev-sdk** — LLM (dev only; static export excludes API routes)

The platform is deployed on **GitHub Pages** (free, 24/7/365, public, no NDA required).

## Future architecture moves

1. **WebContainer for Node** — TypeScript/JavaScript samples could run in-browser via WebContainer (full Node runtime in Wasm). Same lazy-load pattern as Pyodide.

2. **Adaptive drawer content** — extend the contextual bandit to drawer content. If a user always opens the "Code" tab first on Databricks but "Datasets" first on Knowledge, the drawer could default to that tab per page. Beta(α, β) on tab-open events per page.

3. **Serverless agent endpoint** — the `/api/agent-triage` route works on dev preview only (static export excludes API routes). A serverless deployment (Vercel/Cloudflare Workers) could make the agent work on the public site too.

4. **Cross-page memory** — the floating button currently resets its dismissed state on each page. A smarter version: remember "this user always dismisses the tooltip" → after 3 dismissals, never show it again.

5. **Carbon-aware scheduling** — for the dev preview (which runs a server), schedule the agent's LLM calls to times when grid carbon intensity is low. The static site doesn't have this issue (no server).

This document is the canonical reference for the platform's architecture. When in doubt: **lazy-load it, put it in a drawer, and make the page lightweight.**
